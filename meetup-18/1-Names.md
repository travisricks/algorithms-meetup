# Names

## Summary

You've adopted a pet and have no idea what to name to give your new family member. You decide to take suggestions from the internet. After day, the suggestions have exploded and you have a very long list of names, some of the names repeated multiple times.

Write an algorithm that will take the array of strings and output another array of unique names.

## Input

An array of strings

## Output

An array of strings without repeated strings

## Example

```
Example 1
Input:
["Bob", "Ross", "Guy", "Taco", "Waffles", "Ross", "Felix", "Felix", "Waffles"]

Output:
["Bob", "Ross", "Guy", "Taco", "Waffles", "Felix"]

Example 2
Input:
["Taco", "Taco", "Taco", "Felix", "Taco", "Burrito", "Pino"]

Output:
["Taco", "Felix", "Burrito", "Pina"]
```
## Constraints

You cannot use Sets.

## Tips

Try to get it to O(n) time complexity!
